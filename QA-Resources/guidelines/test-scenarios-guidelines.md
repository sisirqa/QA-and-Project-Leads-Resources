## Purpose of Test Scenarios

Test scenarios are designed to:
- Provide a high-level overview of functionality to be tested.
- Ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are considered.
- Facilitate the creation of detailed test cases.
- Enhance communication among team members regarding testing coverage.

## Structure of a Test Scenario

Each test scenario should contain the following elements:

1. **Scenario ID**: A unique identifier for the scenario.
2. **Scenario Description**: A brief statement explaining what the scenario covers.
3. **Preconditions**: Any necessary conditions or setup required before executing the scenario.
4. **Test Steps**: High-level steps to follow to execute the scenario.
5. **Expected Outcome**: The anticipated result of executing the test steps.

## Guidelines for Writing Test Scenarios

1. **Clarity**: Use clear and concise language to describe the scenario and expected outcomes.
2. **Brevity**: Keep scenarios focused and avoid unnecessary details that might clutter understanding.
3. **Traceability**: Ensure each scenario is linked to specific requirements to maintain coverage and accountability.
4. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact scenarios that reflect critical functionality or user journeys.
5. **Inclusiveness**: Consider both positive and negative scenarios to ensure thorough testing.

## Best Practices

- **Collaborate with Stakeholders**: Involve product owners, developers, and other stakeholders in defining scenarios to gather diverse insights.
- **Review and Revise**: Periodically review scenarios to ensure they remain relevant as the application evolves.
- **Maintain a Central Repository**: Use a centralized location to store and manage test scenarios for easy access and tracking.
- **Use Scenario Templates**: Standardize scenario writing by using templates that outline the required elements.

## Examples of Test Scenarios

### Example 1: User Login
| **Scenario ID** | TS_LOGIN_001 |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Description** | Verify user can log in with valid credentials |
| **Preconditions** | User is on the login page |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Enter valid username <br> 2. Enter valid password <br> 3. Click "Login" |
| **Expected Outcome** | User is successfully redirected to the dashboard |

### Example 2: User Registration
| **Scenario ID** | TS_REGISTRATION_001 |
|------------------|---------------------|
| **Description** | Verify user can register with valid information |
| **Preconditions** | User is on the registration page |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Enter valid email <br> 2. Enter strong password <br> 3. Click "Register" |
| **Expected Outcome** | User receives a confirmation email and is redirected to the welcome page |

### Example 3: Password Reset
| **Scenario ID** | TS_PASSWORD_RESET_001 |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Description** | Verify user can reset password using valid email |
| **Preconditions** | User is on the login page |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Click "Forgot Password?" link <br> 2. Enter registered email <br> 3. Click "Submit" |
| **Expected Outcome** | User receives a password reset link via email |

## Conclusion

Creating well-defined test scenarios is essential for effective software testing. By adhering to these guidelines, you can ensure that your testing efforts are comprehensive, organized, and aligned with project requirements.
