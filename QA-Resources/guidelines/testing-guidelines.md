## Types of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components of the code in isolation to ensure each part functions as expected.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different modules or services work together as intended.
3. **Functional Testing**: Validates the software against functional requirements.
4. **Regression Testing**: Re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure previously developed and tested software still works after a change.
5. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Final phase of testing, where real users test the software in a real-world environment.
6. **Performance Testing**: Assesses the speed, scalability, and stability of the software under different conditions.

## Testing Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the project.
2. **Test Planning**: Defining the scope of testing, resources required, deadlines, and the testing strategy.
3. **Test Design**: Creating detailed test cases, test scripts, and test data.
4. **Test Execution**: Running the test cases and logging the results.
5. **Defect Reporting**: Logging defects found during testing into the defect tracking system.
6. **Test Closure**: Reviewing the testing process, ensuring all critical issues are resolved, and summarizing the results.

## Test Case Creation

- **Objective**: Clearly state what the test is intended to verify.
- **Preconditions**: Specify any preconditions or setup needed before the test.
- **Steps to Execute**: List the steps to follow to execute the test.
- **Expected Results**: Define what the expected output should be.
- **Postconditions**: Actions or conditions to restore the system state after the test.

*Example Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Precondition | Steps to Execute | Expected Result | Postcondition |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| TC001        | Login functionality | User is on the login page | 1. Enter valid username <br> 2. Enter valid password <br> 3. Click "Login" | User successfully logs in | User is redirected to dashboard |

## Test Execution

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure all required environments (staging, production, etc.) are properly configured.
- **Test Run**: Execute test cases, record outcomes, and log defects when the actual result does not match the expected result.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that recent changes do not negatively affect existing functionality.

## Defect Reporting

- **Defect ID**: Assign a unique identifier to each defect.
- **Description**: Briefly describe the defect.
- **Severity**: Classify the severity (Critical, Major, Minor).
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide detailed steps to replicate the defect.
- **Expected vs. Actual Results**: Clearly state what was expected and what actually occurred.
- **Attachments**: Add relevant screenshots or logs to support the defect.

*Example Defect Report*:
| Defect ID | Description | Severity | Steps to Reproduce | Expected Result | Actual Result | Attachments |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| DEF001    | Login button not working | Critical | 1. Go to login page <br> 2. Enter credentials <br> 3. Click "Login" | User should log in | No action on button click | Screenshot |

## Examples of Testing and Guidelines

### 1. **Unit Testing Example**
**Objective**: Verify that the `addToCart` function adds an item to the shopping cart correctly.

**Guidelines**:
- Isolate the function to ensure no dependencies (mock external APIs).
- Write test cases for both success and failure scenarios.
- Ensure the function handles edge cases (e.g., adding the same item twice).

*Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Steps to Execute | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| UT001        | Add item to cart | 1. Call `addToCart("Item A")` with item ID "A" <br> 2. Verify cart contains item | Cart contains 1 instance of Item A |

### 2. **Integration Testing Example**
**Objective**: Verify that the checkout process integrates correctly with the payment gateway.

**Guidelines**:
- Test end-to-end data flow between the cart, checkout, and payment systems.
- Mock the payment gateway if possible to avoid real transactions during testing.
- Verify the correct data is passed to the payment gateway, and responses are handled.

*Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Steps to Execute | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| IT001        | Checkout process with payment gateway | 1. Add items to cart <br> 2. Proceed to checkout <br> 3. Enter payment details <br> 4. Confirm order | Payment processed successfully, and order placed |

### 3. **Functional Testing Example**
**Objective**: Validate the login functionality of the application.

**Guidelines**:
- Verify the correct behavior for valid and invalid credentials.
- Test for field validations (e.g., mandatory fields, input format).
- Ensure proper redirection after a successful login.

*Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Steps to Execute | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| FT001        | Login with valid credentials | 1. Navigate to login page <br> 2. Enter valid username and password <br> 3. Click "Login" | User is redirected to dashboard |
| FT002        | Login with invalid password | 1. Navigate to login page <br> 2. Enter valid username and invalid password <br> 3. Click "Login" | Error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed |

### 4. **Regression Testing Example**
**Objective**: Ensure the recent changes to the payment method donâ€™t break existing functionality.

**Guidelines**:
- Execute previously successful test cases to check if they still pass.
- Focus on critical user journeys (login, checkout, etc.).
- Prioritize test cases that involve modified code.

*Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Steps to Execute | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| RT001        | Re-run login test after payment method update | 1. Execute FT001 test case | User is redirected to dashboard |

### 5. **Performance Testing Example**
**Objective**: Ensure the website can handle 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

**Guidelines**:
- Simulate real-world user behavior.
- Set performance benchmarks for response times.
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory) under load.

*Test Case*:
| Test Case ID | Description | Steps to Execute | Expected Result |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| PT001        | Load testing with 1000 concurrent users | 1. Simulate 1000 users browsing and purchasing items <br> 2. Monitor response times and resource usage | Response times are under 3 seconds, no crashes |

## Best Practices

1. **Start Early**: Begin testing as early as possible in the development process.
2. **Automation**: Where possible, automate repetitive test cases (e.g., regression tests) to save time.
3. **Clear Communication**: Ensure test cases and defect reports are clearly communicated to all stakeholders.
4. **Version Control**: Use a version control system to manage test scripts and documentation.
5. **Document Everything**: Always document test cases, test results, and defect reports for future reference.
