## Purpose of Test Cases

Test cases serve several critical functions, including:
- Verifying that software functions as intended.
- Identifying defects early in the development process.
- Providing documentation that can be referred to in the future.
- Facilitating communication among team members about expected behavior.

## Structure of a Test Case

Each test case should include the following components:

1. **Test Case ID**: A unique identifier for the test case.
2. **Test Description**: A brief summary of what the test case will verify.
3. **Preconditions**: Conditions that must be met before executing the test.
4. **Test Steps**: A clear, sequential list of actions to perform during the test.
5. **Expected Results**: The anticipated outcome of executing the test steps.
6. **Postconditions**: The state of the system after executing the test, if applicable.

## Guidelines for Writing Test Cases

1. **Clarity**: Use simple and precise language to ensure that anyone can understand the test case.
2. **Consistency**: Follow a standard format for all test cases to maintain uniformity.
3. **Relevance**: Ensure that each test case is relevant to the current requirements and functionalities.
4. **Test Coverage**: Write test cases that cover both positive and negative scenarios, including edge cases.
5. **Traceability**: Link each test case to specific requirements to ensure coverage.

## Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple**: Avoid unnecessary complexity in test steps; simplicity enhances readability and execution.
- **Review and Revise**: Regularly review test cases to ensure they remain relevant and effective as requirements evolve.
- **Involve Stakeholders**: Engage team members in the writing process to gather diverse perspectives and insights.
- **Use Automation Tools**: When possible, integrate automated testing tools to streamline execution and reporting.

## Examples of Test Cases

### Example 1: Login Functionality
| **Test Case ID** | TC_LOGIN_001 |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Description** | Verify successful login with valid credentials |
| **Preconditions** | User is on the login page |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Enter valid username <br> 2. Enter valid password <br> 3. Click "Login" |
| **Expected Results** | User is redirected to the dashboard successfully |
| **Postconditions** | User session is active |

### Example 2: Login with Invalid Credentials
| **Test Case ID** | TC_LOGIN_002 |
|------------------|---------------|
| **Description** | Verify error message for invalid login |
| **Preconditions** | User is on the login page |
| **Test Steps** | 1. Enter invalid username <br> 2. Enter invalid password <br> 3. Click "Login" |
| **Expected Results** | An error message "Invalid credentials" is displayed |
| **Postconditions** | User remains on the login page |

## Conclusion

Writing effective test cases is crucial for ensuring thorough testing and maintaining software quality. By following these guidelines, you can create test cases that are clear, concise, and valuable for your testing efforts.
